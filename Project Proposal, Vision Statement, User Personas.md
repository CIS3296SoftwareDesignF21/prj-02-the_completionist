# Project Proposal

The Completionist is a productivity toolbox designed primarily to help students and professionals increase productivity. The Completionist is a desktop application that will be coded in Java with a command-line interface. At the core of the application, there is the ability to create a to-do list and calendar. The user will be able to add tasks to the to-do list and events to the calendar. The to-do list and calendar will be integrated together so that the calendar can import tasks into the daily to-do list, and the calendar itself can be viewed to see tasks/events in the future. Besides the to-do list and calendar, there will also be several other key features designed to increase productivity. These features include a Pomodoro timer, which is a timer that breaks up work into 25 minute intervals, and a quick Notes feature. To incentivize users, there will be a reward system behind all these features. Users will be able to unlock different things which will motivate them to continue using the app and to stay productive. After discussing with the team, we have decided on some new features as well. One new feature is a daily motivational quote that the user sees when they open the application. Another feature is to incorporate folders of tasks in order to break down a big task into smaller parts. We will implement a task completion bar that will update when a task is completed. We also talked about having a Focus Mode for the app that blocks all notifications and prohibits certain apps from being used. If a user opens one of those apps, they receive a notification reminding them to stay focused on their goals. Finally we decided on a feature that tracks each task, similar to a Trello board, so that the user can visualize all of their tasks in one place.

This project fulfils many of the educational goals of this assignment and course. By starting from scratch and with a group of people, the application will be built from the ground up. Therefore, we will be heavily focused on development, version control, testing, and most importantly, management. Since there are numerous tools to be implemented into the application, dividing up tasks amongst a group to tackle individual aspects of the app should not be a problem. The project will include several aspects that have been learned in the course thus far: scheduled meetings with the group, design, unified modeling language, test driven development, graphic user interface, design, optimization, and more. The project proposal does seem complex, especially with all the tools that we plan on implementing. To start, creating the to-do list and calendar are the first objectives of the project. Getting them working, and more importantly, working alongside one another will be the first thing to tackle. When finished, The Completionist will help both students and professionals increase their productivity levels and stay focused on their numerous tasks.

# Vision Statement

For students and professionals who have homework, work, and other important tasks they need to complete, The Completionist is a desktop application that is designed to increase productivity through integrated features such as a to-do list, a calendar, a Pomodoro timer, and a Notes section, among others. Unlike other applications, such as Evernote or Google Calendar aimed at increasing productivity, our product includes features that work together to make the user experience as seamless as possible and is aimed at helping both students and professionals.

# User Personas

## Persona 1: The Try-Hard Student
John is a try hard college student at a prestigious college. He has a high GPA, belongs to multiple clubs and organizations, and serves as the president of some of them. He is also taking 4 classes and 1 lab. He wants to maintain his GPA and be a great president for his clubs. To this end, he keeps a very detailed calendar/planner and to-do list to help him stay on top of the numerous tasks he needs to accomplish. Currently, this calendar/planner is a hard copy and his to-do list is electronic since he spends most of his time on the computer. He realized that it is inefficient to have a physical calendar and electronic to-do list because he has to constantly look at his calendar and update it, and vice versa with his to-do list. What would make his life easier is if his calendar and to-do list can interact with each other, that way he doesn’t have to spend too much time on bookkeeping. He has tried multiple productivity apps before such as Google Calendar and Evernote, however Google Calendar lacks the interactivity with to-do list and Evernote costs money. Ideally, what John wants is an application that has an interactive calendar and to-do list that can update if he works with one or the other.

### Persona 2: The Slacker Student
Timmy is about to be a freshman in highschool in the United States. He knows that Freshman year is an important year because it means that grades, extracurriculars, and more are attached to his permanent record, altogether contributing to his future college applications. In regard to grades, Timmy excelled in grade school and the first year of middle school. He got by without studying, achieving fantastic marks by just going to school. In his last year of middle school, he started to notice that the workload and difficulty of courses was increasing, and he barely scraped by just passing his classes. Now that high school is on the horizon, he decides to make a change to better his future. Timmy plans on taking classes with decent rigor, participating on the school’s track team, and taking leadership as president of the video games club. With this type of plan, he needs something to aid with his time management and distribution of workload so that he is able to stay focused and disciplined, all while focusing on his ultimate goal to craft an amazing college application by the time he is ready to apply. Timmy never used a calendar or to-do list of any kind, though he is aware that it will help him immensely. He is in search of an all-in-one application that is able to track his daily tasks and future events. To concentrate for prolonged periods of time, he would also like a pomodoro timer for productivity sessions and a quick notes feature so that he can jot ideas before they leave his mind. 

### Persona 3: The Not So Tech-Savvy Teacher
Lydia is an 8th grade teacher who is going into her 40th year of teaching. Back when she was being taught in school she barely had any access to a computer, and once she began teaching it took many years before there were computers in every classroom. Now, it seems like everywhere Lydia looks, there is some new device popping up around her school. Being that she is a little older than some of her younger colleagues, she hasn’t been able to keep up with all the latest technology that’s been coming out and is having trouble figuring it out. She has always been a pen and paper woman who has been able to get by writing down all the things she’s needed to know. However, Lydia can see how the world is changing and wants to start being a more active participant in learning more about how technology can better improve her busy life of lesson planning and teaching. As of now, she relies on post-it notes and small scraps of paper to keep track of all her tasks and the things she needs to get done. The problem she oftens runs into, though, is that she misplaces those notes often and finds herself forgetting to complete important tasks. Just the other day, she forgot to write up a lesson plan for her class and was forced to have them watch a video instead of actually being able to teach them. Lydia wishes that she could have a place to put all of her tasks at once, where she can check them off as she goes. With an ever-changing schedule with meetings and new school events, she’d also like for a way to have future tasks be linked to a calendar where every morning she can check which tasks need to be done for a certain day. She has events that relate to her grandchildren that she wants to be a part of, so having a way to separate tasks related to work and personal agendas would be a great feature. Lydia is looking for a way to organize her tasks staying on top of all her work, while using an easy and easily understandable piece of technology. 

### Persona 4: The Small Business Owner 
Grace is a 25 year old woman who graduated with her Masters in Business and now owns her own small consulting firm. As a small business owner, she has a full schedule with a seemingly endless list of tasks to do each day. She wants to provide the best services for her existing clients while also working everyday to build her business up and expand her clientele. In addition, she has about 15 employees working for her and she needs to manage them successfully so that they can perform to the best of their ability. Currently, she has several different systems in place, some electronic and some physical, to manage all her work. However, she finds it cumbersome to navigate through the different systems and would prefer if everything was organized nicely in one place. Grace has tried other applications that would let her see everything in one place, but she finds most of them overwhelming with the abundance of information and graphics. Grace is looking for a simple application that will let her remove the chaos that comes with owning a business.

### Persona 5: The Average High Schooler
Justin is a 16 year old high school student who just began his Honors and AP classes in high school and is under high pressure from his parents to obtain good grades so that he can get into a good college. He typically finds that there are many after school distractions such as texts from his friends and other notifications that restrict him from getting as much work done as he wants to which leads to him falling behind occasionally. Justin wants a distraction free environment that allows him to finish his work in a timely manner. He wants a very simple user experience where there are no notifications and the ability to take notes so he can get his work done as soon as possible and get back to his daily after school and weekend activities.

### Persona 6: The Work From Home Professional
Frank is a 34 year old with a bachelors from Penn State, currently working in IT tech support. Due to COVID and the nature of his work, he can remotely work from home. He has a full schedule with weekly meetings and daily calls to high profile clients. He wants to remain punctual while still being able to focus on his work without checking his calendar and clock multiple times per day. Frank also leads a small team of yearly interns at his company, so he must manage and check in with them 2-3 times per day. He currently uses a multitude of sticky notes and a physical planner to track and remind himself of things he must do daily. 

# Implementation
Calendar, we will use the Java calendar object.

# Dynamic Ideas, Insights, and Feedback
## Week 1:
### Ideas
- Adam proposes a feature of the app that breaks down large tasks/goals into chunks. Integrating folders of some kind and a task completion bar. Sometimes, looking at the big picture is overwhelming, and breaking things into smaller pieces makes things easier. 
- Tuan proposes a feature of the app that reads motivational quotes. Life can be stressful, so motivation is the extra push. 
- Someone proposed a feature of the app that puts the computer into focus mode. By the user’s choice, it will disable the functionality of other apps that cause distractions. 
### Insights
- For the calendar implementation, we need to incorporate one month at a time. If a certain event falls on the current date, the task/event is brought into the daily to-do list. Infinite while loop that constantly checks time roll over into 12am. If that time strikes, the task is moved. Calendar view will be one month at a time. Viewing the calendar will show all events for the month on one screen. Current ideas for approach. Instantiate each day for a month… we will standardize it to 30 days. One text document corresponds to a month, we will use a delimiter to find each instance of a day. It will pull the contents of the array which are the events/tasks for the calendar.          
### Feedback
- N/A

## Week 2:
### Ideas
- Adam proposes the idea to add a feature for tags. These tags can be used to sort tasks that are added to the to-do list and calendar. This prevents clutter and promotes more organization to create a divide between lifestyle tasks, school tasks, work tasks, and whatever the user desires.
### Insights
- For the calendar, Tuan and I will work on a feature that reads the calendar/month text file that is created. There will be splicing and tokenizing to sort out the events that have been added to the calendar. The resulting output should print to stdout the current state of the created calendar.
### Feedback
- Collective efforts as a group were really good. We received feedback from Professor Letarte that it is better to work on certain tasks/features collectively rather than all to be working on something different. For the sake of demos, the Professor tells us that we should be able to demo what each person has been working on. In this previous week, 2 people were assigned to work on a certain aspect of the application, though it is kind of difficult to demo everyone’s progress at the same time considering we are all at different paces, and we have not been doing our best to implement everything as we go. Greater communication and less division amongst tasks will be applied for the following week.

The Completionist is a desktop application coded primarily in Java with a command-line user interface that is designed to help increase productivity for students and professionals. 

The key features of this software include:
1. To-Do List
2. Calendar
2. Pomodoro Timer
3. Notes

These features are able to communicate and interact with each other. For example, when the user adds tasks to the to-do list, those tasks will also be added to the calendar. The calendar is able to import the tasks of the day into a daily to-do list. Besides the calendar and to-do list, The Completionist has a toolbox assortment of features to improve productivity. The Pomodoro Timer is derived from the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals of 25 minutes, separated by short breaks. We implement our own version of the Pomodoro Timer in The Completionist to help users stay on top of their work. Additionally, the Notes tool will allow users to quickly jot down ideas to help sort through their thoughts.
